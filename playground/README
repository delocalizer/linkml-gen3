Simple workflow using gen-json-schema tool provided by LinkML:

* program_linkml.yaml was what was suggested by ChatGPT as being the LinkML
  equivalent of the original program.json
* program_fromlinkml.json is output from:
```
gen-json-schema \
	-i \
	--closed \
	program_linkml.yaml > program_fromlinkml.json
```
Note 1: the result contains everything embedded in `$defs`, which may need to
be extracted and promoted, depending on what you want as the final output

Note 2: uniqueKeys, links etc that are defined in the GDC metaschema but
aren't part of regular JSON schema, are not emitted here. We'd need to write
a custom handler for that.
